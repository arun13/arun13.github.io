# Impacts of Coronavirus on Daily Life and Public Health

## Introduction

#### This narrative visualization is describing how coronavirus has impacted the human lives over the duration of pandemic.This visualization walks through different charts related to daily death toll world observed,people getting infected, lockdowns and icu admission due to Coronavirus.

## Narrative Structure 

#### This Narrative visualization follows "interactive slide show" structure. To display charts in slides manner, I have added buttons in vertical sequence for user to click and display those charts to walk user through visualization and giving opportunity to explore of the impact of coronavirus on the world


## Visual structure 

#### Every chart is a line chart providing different aspects of impact of coronavirus.There are 2 views which connects user to the charts to further drill down using button clicks.These 2 views of the slides can be selected using radio buttons on the screen. 
#### 1. Default View Charts 
#### 2. Country Specific View Charts.
#### If first view is selected which is also default selection. Then All the charts will display data for the 10 major countries together.These charts are annotated to provide user valuable informaion related to the impact of coronavirus.
#### If second view is selected then all the charts will be displayed specfic to a country, which gives user more drill down to the data related to a particular country.
#### In the country specific view User is provided with tool-tip option to provide the specific data on a particular point on the chart of the scene.
## Scenes of Visualization
#### There are four scenes of visualization  which are as follows 
#### 1. Infection Spikes
#### 2. ICU Admission
#### 3. Loss of Life
#### 4. Daily Life Disruption
#### So these scenes orders tell the story of impact.It started with rise in cases of people getting infected. After that those people got too sick that they had to be admitted to ICU.Some of those people lost their lives while fighting with infection.Because of this significant public health impacts and rising death tolls, Governments across the world started to implement lockdowns in their countries.Business were shutdown and schools were closed to stop the spread of virus, this is measured by Stringency Index. Higher index means more strict are the guidelines.    

## Annotations
#### For the default view annotations are added to all the four scenes to help user gather the valuable information from the data.To highlight particular area of the line chart, Callout Annotation Circle is used to show the user the particular area of concern when the covid had hugely impacted the lives of people.

## Parameters
#### There are two parameters. One parameter is to control the type charts we want to display.If the view is selected to "Default View", then all the scenes will display line graphs for all the countries. If the country specific view is selected then all the scenes will display charts specific to the country selected in the select dropdown box.

## Trigger
#### In Country specific view , User can select the select any country being in country specific view and view of the scenes will be switched to the country selected.
#### I have added labels on the top of radio button selection and on the top chart buttons to help user select the option. Once user select "Country Specific View" ,an alert will also be popped up to ask use to click the scene button after selecting the country from dropdown.
